## Unreleased

### Added

- **Durable chunk-level outbound delivery.** User-visible channel messages are now persisted before
  the first network call and tracked as independently retryable chunks. Interrupted sends resume
  from the unfinished chunk after restart, the full logical reply is stored exactly once, and
  Weixin reuses a stable native `client_id` for safe retries. Scheduler runs distinguish immediate
  delivery from durable queued acceptance instead of duplicating the full message in the outbox.
- **Shared user-visible output sanitization.** Final channel delivery strips private reasoning tags
  and textual tool-call traces at the common delivery boundary, including scheduler and tool-driven
  messages, so runtime protocol details do not leak into Weixin or other chat channels.
- **`microclaw doctor delivery`.** A read-only diagnostic now reports durable-ledger totals,
  unfinished chunks, retry state, oldest unfinished work, and terminal delivery failures without
  sending a test message or exposing credentials.
- Long channel replies now preserve newline bytes at chunk boundaries, so concatenating delivered
  chunks reconstructs the sanitized logical reply exactly instead of losing one newline per split.

- **Output guardrail (credential leak protection).** A new `output_guardrail` config block
  (`mode: off | redact | block`, default **off**) scans outbound bot messages for credential-like
  strings (OpenAI/Anthropic keys, GitHub PATs, AWS keys, Slack/Google tokens, Bearer tokens, PEM
  private-key blocks, `api_key=` assignments) before they are delivered. `redact` masks the secret
  and still delivers; `block` withholds the message. Applied both to each channel's main reply and
  to the shared tool/scheduler delivery path, so a secret echoed from tool output, memory, or the
  model can't leak to a chat. Detection reuses `microclaw-core`'s `redact` module, split so the
  outbound path strips **credentials only** (emails/phone numbers the bot legitimately sends are
  left intact). Every trip is logged to the `output_guardrail` trace target.
- **Pluggable web-search backends.** `web_search` (and the new `deep_research` tool) can now run
  against DuckDuckGo (default, no key), a self-hosted **SearXNG** instance, **Brave Search**, or
  **Tavily** — selected via the new `web_search` config block (`backend`, `searxng_base_url`,
  `brave_api_key`, `tavily_api_key`, `max_results`). Defaults preserve the historical DuckDuckGo
  behavior exactly, and a backend selected without its credentials/endpoint transparently
  degrades to DuckDuckGo instead of failing.
- **`deep_research` tool** — a deterministic multi-source research pass: fans out several
  sub-queries across the configured search backend, deduplicates sources, concurrently fetches the
  top pages through the existing SSRF-guarded `web_fetch` path, and returns a citation-numbered
  evidence digest with source-agreement signals (corroboration across sub-queries, coverage gaps).
  Semantic cross-verification and synthesis are left to the agent reading the digest, so the tool
  runs no LLM and is fully deterministic. Available to the main agent and to research sub-agents.

### Changed

- Clearer channel auth-failure logs — when a channel can't start because its credentials are
  rejected, Telegram/Discord/Slack/Feishu now log an actionable message ("authentication
  failed … check the token / run `microclaw setup`") instead of a generic or silent error,
  so a bad token isn't mistaken for the bot just going quiet. Part of the usability push.

### Added

- More guidance in the CLI: after `microclaw setup` succeeds it now prints the next steps
  (`microclaw doctor` → `microclaw start`, with a note about `doctor --online`); and
  `microclaw eval --help`, `microclaw audit --help`, and `microclaw doctor --help` each end
  with an Examples section. (`doctor --help` now routes to the doctor parser so its options and
  examples actually show.) Part of the usability push.
- Setup wizard now labels every field `[required]` or `[optional]` (previously only required
  fields were marked, leaving "unmarked" ambiguous), so it's obvious at a glance what must be
  filled before saving. Part of the usability push.
- `microclaw --help` now ends with an **Examples** section (setup, doctor, `doctor --online`,
  start, `skill audit`, `audit verify`, `eval`) and a pointer to per-command `--help`, so the
  common workflows are discoverable without reading docs. Part of the usability push.
- `microclaw doctor` now checks that the data and working directories can be created and
  written to — the most common "won't start" cause (read-only path, wrong permissions, a
  typo'd `data_dir`). Reports each as ✅ writable or ❌ with the failure reason and a fix hint.
  Part of the usability push.
- Setup wizard now refuses to save a config with no channel enabled — the source-side fix for
  "configured a channel but forgot `enabled: true`". Clearing all channels blocks save with a
  clear instruction instead of producing a config that fails to start. (The field defaults to
  `web`, so a normal setup is unaffected.) Part of the usability push.
- `microclaw doctor --online` — verifies the LLM credentials by sending a minimal "hi" request
  to the configured provider (reusing the setup wizard's probe), so a bad API key or model is
  caught at preflight instead of surfacing as a confusing failure on the first chat. Rejected
  credentials are a ❌ FAIL with a fix hint; a network/transient failure is a ⚠️ WARN (so an
  offline run isn't falsely red); `openai-codex` is skipped (external auth). Without `--online`,
  `doctor` stays hermetic and notes that credentials weren't verified. Part of the usability push.
- Clearer "no channel enabled" diagnostics — the common trap of filling in a channel's
  credentials but forgetting `enabled: true` now produces an actionable message instead of a
  generic one: the config error (and `microclaw start`) name the configured-but-disabled
  channels and tell you to set `channels.<name>.enabled: true`. `microclaw doctor` now (a)
  actually loads & validates the config (previously it only checked the file exists, so an
  invalid config showed a misleading green), and (b) reports which channels are enabled plus
  warns about any configured-but-disabled ones. Part of the usability/onboarding push.
- Friendlier config parse errors — when `microclaw.config.yaml` fails to parse, the message now
  appends an actionable pointer (edit and re-run, or `microclaw setup`, plus a link to the
  annotated example config), and for an unknown field/variant (a mistyped key like `discrod`)
  it suggests the closest valid name ("did you mean `discord`?"). The original serde error
  with its line/column is preserved. Part of the usability/onboarding push.
- In-chat `/help` command (aliases `/commands`, `/?`) — lists every slash command with a
  one-line description, grouped by area (session & context, model & provider, skills,
  memory & usage). There was previously no way to discover the 15+ commands from inside a
  chat. The CLI quick-start (`microclaw --help`) now points new users to it. First of a
  usability/onboarding push.
- Per-task auxiliary models: a new `aux_models` config section lets a (typically
  cheaper) model handle ancillary work. Wired slots:
  - `aux_models.compaction` — context/history summarization.
  - `aux_models.reflector` — the background memory reflector (fact/triple extraction),
    which runs periodically per active chat.
  - `aux_models.title` — one-shot session-title generation.
  - `aux_models.vision` — image description (the `describe_image` tool); overrides
    `media.vision.model` when set, and an explicit per-call `model` argument still wins.

  (`session_search` has no LLM step — it is pure full-text search — so it has no slot.)
- Tamper-evident audit log — every new `audit_logs` entry is now sealed into a SHA-256
  hash chain (`entry_hash` over the entry's fields plus the previous entry's `entry_hash`,
  with a genesis link for the first). Modifying a field, deleting a row, or reordering rows
  breaks the chain. A new `microclaw audit verify` command walks the chain and reports the
  first broken link (exiting non-zero so it can gate monitoring/CI), and `microclaw audit
  list [--kind] [--limit]` prints recent entries. Sealing happens under the DB connection
  lock so concurrent writers can't race the chain; pre-migration rows stay unsealed and are
  simply excluded from verification. First slice of the v0.4.0 security-governance track
  (tamper-evident audit).

  Each auxiliary model reuses the main provider profile and credentials — only the
  model name is swapped — and falls back to the main model when unset, so default
  behavior is unchanged. First steps toward the v0.3.0 "Self-Improving Runtime" plan
  (`docs/roadmap/v0.3.0-self-improving-runtime.md`).
- Sleep-time memory consolidation (`sleep_time`, off by default) — when a chat has been
  idle for a while, a background loop runs a deterministic (no-LLM) pass that archives
  near-duplicate same-category memories, so the store stops accumulating redundancy
  between reflector runs. PROFILE (identity) memories are never touched, archiving is
  reversible, and the pass is throttled per chat (`min_interval_hours`) and capped
  (`max_archived_per_pass`). First slice of the v0.3.0 sleep-time consolidation (Pillar 1c).
- `microclaw eval` subcommand — a deterministic trajectory-evaluation gate for recorded
  agent sessions, with no LLM call. It replays a session fixture (a JSON array of
  messages, or an object with a `messages` array) and checks trajectory health:
  no dangling `tool_use`, no orphaned `tool_result`, the session ends on a real answer
  (not a raw `tool_result`), tool-call count within `--max-tool-calls`, and tool errors
  surfaced (failing only under `--strict-tool-errors`). It also flags **stuck loops**
  (the same tool + arguments repeated `--max-repeats` times) and **consecutive
  tool-error streaks** (`--max-error-streak`). Accepts a file or a directory of
  fixtures, supports `--json`, and exits non-zero on failure so it can gate CI. Sample
  fixtures and usage in `docs/test/eval-fixtures/`. First slice of the v0.3.0 evaluation
  gate (Pillar 5). Enforced in CI via a "Trajectory eval gate" step that runs the
  passing fixtures in `docs/test/eval-fixtures/` (negative examples live in
  `docs/test/eval-fixtures/negative/`).
- `microclaw skill audit` subcommand — a deterministic, read-only curation view over the
  local skill corpus (no LLM, no DB, no mutation). `skill_review` distills a skill from a
  single session and the reflector retires skills purely by inactivity age; neither gives a
  cross-skill picture. The audit surfaces the signals a curator needs: **near-duplicate**
  skills (token-Jaccard over name + description — merge candidates, and a retire signal when
  an `agent-created` skill shadows a built-in), **stale** `agent-created` skills (old/absent
  `updated_at`), **thin** `agent-created` skills (near-empty body), and **cap headroom**
  against the `agent-created` ceiling. Built-in/human-curated skills are never flagged for
  retirement (they stay immutable) but still participate in duplicate detection. Accepts an
  optional directory argument (defaults to the configured skills dir), supports `--json`,
  and `--strict` exits non-zero when anything actionable is found, so it can gate CI. First
  slice of the v0.3.0 skill curator (Pillar 2).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-01

Milestone release consolidating everything since the 0.1.12 maturity-hardening
baseline: a concurrent specialist team, humanlike behavior, graph-augmented
memory, mid-turn interactivity, a multimedia tool suite, more channels, and
hardened packaging/release automation.

### Added

#### Agent capabilities

- Concurrent specialist team with 30 factory-ready skills and a more human
  conversational style (#391); specialist-to-specialist collaboration via the
  `consult_specialist` tool (#394)
- Humanlike follow-ups — progress-reports toggle, relationship familiarity, and
  task ETA (#392); bounded research-hard traits: humor timing, per-user growth,
  and group interjection (#393)
- Graph-augmented memory recall over the temporal knowledge graph (#395); broader
  memory & skill optimizations inspired by hermes-agent (#329)
- Concurrent mode — per-chat turn serialization with parallel tool execution
  (#320) and a chat-abort method to interrupt in-flight turns (#318)
- Mid-turn message injection for interactive agent turns (#330), with a
  real-time injection acknowledgement on non-web channels (#345)
- ACP-backed external subagent runtime (#283)

#### Tools

- `session_search` tool backed by a new SQLite FTS5 index over messages, for cross-conversation recall (schema migration v21, ported from hermes-agent's `session_search_tool.py`). Scoped to the caller's chat by default; cross-chat access goes through `authorize_chat_access` and the new `all_chats: true` opt-in is gated to control chats.
- `osv_check` tool that queries the OSV.dev advisory database for package vulnerabilities across npm, PyPI, crates.io, RubyGems, Maven, NuGet, Packagist, Hex, Pub, and Go (ported from hermes-agent's `osv_check.py`)
- `clarify` tool that sends a structured multi-choice or open-ended question through the caller's channel and releases the turn so the next user message naturally supplies the answer (ported from hermes-agent's `clarify_tool.py`)
- SSRF pre-flight checks on `web_fetch` that block requests pointing at loopback, link-local, private, CGNAT, unique-local IPv6, and cloud-metadata addresses (new `block_private_ips` field on `web_fetch_url_validation`, on by default; ported from hermes-agent's `url_safety.py`)
- Six further hermes-agent ports: prompt caching, fuzzy edit, guardrails, checkpoints, `@`-references, and subdir hints (#342)
- Multimedia tool suite (OpenAI-compatible, disabled by default, opt-in per tool via `media.<tool>.enabled`):
  - `generate_image` — POST `/v1/images/generations`; saves PNG under `<data_dir>/media/images/` and delivers via channel attachment when supported
  - `describe_image` — POST `/v1/chat/completions` with an image content block; accepts file paths (inside working_dir), URLs, or `data:` URIs
  - `text_to_speech` — POST `/v1/audio/speech`; saves MP3/OGG/etc. under `<data_dir>/media/audio/` and delivers via channel attachment
  - `transcribe_audio` — POST `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart); exposes Whisper-style STT as an agent tool
  - Shared `MediaClient` enforces SSRF guard on the configured base URL, redacts API keys from `Debug`, and resolves credentials from (in order) `media.api_key`, `MICROCLAW_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or the existing top-level `openai_api_key`

#### Skills

- `propagation-trace` built-in skill (#384)
- Improved skill scores for microclaw (#279)
- Automated skill review CI for `SKILL.md` pull requests (#311)

#### Channels

- Telegram reply-chain support (#383)
- Native WeChat/Weixin (openclaw-weixin) support (#289) with markdown rendering in outbound messages (#324)
- Feishu/Lark ACK reaction (已读标记), opt-in with simplified emoji selection (#290)
- Mission Control gateway/session bridge and web auth UI improvements (#273, #278)

#### Packaging & release

- Official container image release automation for GHCR, with optional Docker Hub mirroring when repository credentials are configured (#277)
- Windows installer and gateway service support (#269)
- Snap package for Ubuntu and other snap-enabled distros (#325)
- `--full` / `-Full` flag across installer and Homebrew tap for heavy integrations
- Governance documents for security reporting, contribution expectations, and operator support
- CI coverage and dependency-audit gates; release packaging coverage for macOS artifacts and checksum publication
- Stronger config self-check coverage for risky execution settings

### Changed

- Heavy integrations are now optional build features; MCP returned to the default build, with `full` reserved for Matrix only (#313)
- Reduced release artifact size via release-profile tuning (#310)
- Raised the default web inflight limit to 10
- CI now builds the website docs alongside the web UI
- Docker builds now compile embedded web assets inside the image build and default the runtime image to `microclaw start`
- Release process documentation now points to explicit support and release-policy artifacts

### Fixed

- UTF-8-safe string slicing in `memory_backend.rs` and `web.rs` (#381)
- `install.ps1` renames the `$pid` parameter to avoid a PowerShell read-only variable (#344)
- Nix builds derive web npm deps from the lockfile via `importNpmLock` (#333)
- Config updates preserve YAML comments (#332)
- rustls websocket provider panic (#316) and restored websocket session compatibility (#298, #300)
- Normalized malformed OpenAI tool arguments (#304)
- Reflector strips thinking/variant tags from message content before LLM processing (#303)
- Runtime config loading and invalid-model fallback (#301)
