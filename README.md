MicroClaw is an agent runtime for chat surfaces. It gives you one channel-agnostic agent loop, one provider-agnostic LLM layer, and one persistent runtime that can move across Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu/Lark, IRC, Web, and additional adapters over time.

It works with Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers, supports multi-step tool execution, keeps session state across turns, stores durable memory, runs scheduled tasks, and can expose the same runtime through both chat channels and a local web UI.

## Why MicroClaw

- **One runtime, many channels**: keep the same agent loop, tools, memory, and policies across chat platforms.
- **Built for agentic execution**: tool calls, tool-result reflection, sub-agents, planning, and mid-run updates are first-class.
- **Persistent by default**: sessions resume, memory survives restarts, and scheduled tasks keep running in the background.
- **Provider-agnostic**: use Anthropic or OpenAI-compatible APIs without rewriting the runtime.
- **Extensible where it matters**: add skills, MCP servers, plugins, hooks, and new channel adapters without replacing the core.

## Quick Start

Install:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://microclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Run diagnostics:

```sh
microclaw doctor
```

Create config with the interactive wizard:

```sh
microclaw setup
```

Start the runtime:

```sh
microclaw start
```

Default local web UI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:10961
```

If you want a source build instead, jump to [Install](#install). If you want operational details, start with [Setup](#setup) and [Documentation](#documentation).

## Install

### One-line installer (recommended)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://microclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows PowerShell installer

```powershell
iwr https://microclaw.ai/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

This installer only does one thing:
- Download and install the matching prebuilt binary from the latest GitHub release
- It does not fallback to Homebrew/Cargo inside `install.sh` (use separate methods below)

Upgrade in place later:

```sh
microclaw upgrade
```

### Preflight diagnostics

Run cross-platform diagnostics before first start (or when troubleshooting):

```sh
microclaw doctor
```

Machine-readable output for support tickets:

```sh
microclaw doctor --json
```

Checks include PATH, shell runtime, `agent-browser`, PowerShell policy (Windows), and MCP command dependencies from `<data_dir>/mcp.json` plus `<data_dir>/mcp.d/*.json`.

Sandbox-only diagnostics:

```sh
microclaw doctor sandbox
```

### Uninstall (script)

macOS/Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://microclaw.ai/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr https://microclaw.ai/uninstall.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

### Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew tap microclaw/tap
brew install microclaw
```

### Docker image

Release tags publish an official container image to:

- `ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest`
- `ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:<version>`
- `docker.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest` when Docker Hub publishing credentials are configured for the repository

For first-time pulls from GHCR, you may need:

```sh
docker login ghcr.io
```

Use your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token with `read:packages`.

Quickest way to try the image:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 127.0.0.1:10961:10961 \
  ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest
```

Recommended for real use: keep config and runtime data on the host:

```sh
mkdir -p data tmp
chmod a+r microclaw.config.yaml
chmod -R a+rwX data tmp

docker run --rm -it \
  -p 127.0.0.1:10961:10961 \
  -v "$(pwd)/microclaw.config.yaml:/app/microclaw.config.yaml:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/home/microclaw/.microclaw" \
  -v "$(pwd)/tmp:/app/tmp" \
  ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest
```

Why mount them:

- `microclaw.config.yaml`: keep configuration outside the container
- `data/`: persist sessions, memory, skills, database, and runtime state
- `tmp/`: provide a writable temp directory for container-side work

The image entrypoint is `microclaw`, so you can override the command directly:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest doctor
docker run --rm ghcr.io/microclaw/microclaw:latest version
```

If startup fails with `Permission denied (os error 13)`, re-check the `chmod` commands above and verify the mounted paths exist.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microclaw/microclaw.git
cd microclaw
cargo build --release
cp target/release/microclaw /usr/local/bin/
```

Optional semantic-memory build (sqlite-vec disabled by default):

```sh
cargo build --release --features sqlite-vec
```

First-time sqlite-vec quickstart (3 commands):

```sh
cargo run --features sqlite-vec -- setup
cargo run --features sqlite-vec -- start
sqlite3 <data_dir>/runtime/microclaw.db "SELECT id, chat_id, chat_channel, external_chat_id, category, embedding_model FROM memories ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

In `setup`, set:
- `embedding_provider` = `openai` or `ollama`
- provider credentials/base URL/model as needed

## How it works

Every message goes through a shared **agent loop**:

1. Load file memory, structured memory, skills, and resumable session state
2. Call the configured model with tool schemas and runtime context
3. Execute tool calls, append results, and continue the loop until completion
4. Persist the updated session, memory signals, and observability data

This keeps behavior consistent across channels and lets one runtime power interactive chat, scheduled work, web-triggered automation, and sub-agent execution.

## Blog post

For a deeper dive into the architecture and design decisions, read: **[Building MicroClaw: An Agentic AI Assistant in Rust That Lives in Your Chats](https://microclaw.ai/blog/building-microclaw)**

## Features

- **Agentic tool use** -- bash commands, file read/write/edit, glob search, regex grep, persistent memory
- **Session resume** -- full conversation state (including tool interactions) persisted between messages; the agent keeps tool-call state across invocations
- **Context compaction** -- when sessions grow too large, older messages are automatically summarized to stay within context limits
- **Sub-agent** -- delegate self-contained sub-tasks to a parallel agent with restricted tools
- **Agent skills** -- extensible skill system ([Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) compatible); skills are auto-discovered from `<data_dir>/skills/` and activated on demand
- **Plan & execute** -- todo list tools for breaking down complex tasks, tracking progress step by step
- **Platform-extensible architecture** -- shared agent loop + tool system + storage, with platform adapters for channel-specific ingress/egress
- **Web search** -- search the web via DuckDuckGo and fetch/parse web pages
- **Scheduled tasks** -- cron-based recurring tasks and one-time scheduled tasks, managed through natural language
- **Mid-conversation messaging** -- the agent can send intermediate messages before its final response
- **Mention catch-up (Telegram groups)** -- when mentioned in a Telegram group, the bot reads all messages since its last reply (not just the last N)
- **Continuous typing indicator** -- typing indicator stays active for the full duration of processing
- **Persistent memory** -- AGENTS.md files at global, bot/account, and per-chat scopes, loaded into every request
- **Message splitting** -- long responses are automatically split at newline boundaries to fit channel limits (Telegram 4096 / Discord 2000 / Slack 4000 / Feishu 4000 / IRC ~380)

## Memory

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/memory-architecture.svg" alt="MicroClaw memory architecture diagram" width="92%" />
</p>

MicroClaw maintains persistent memory via `AGENTS.md` files:

```
<data_dir>/runtime/groups/
    AGENTS.md                 # Global memory (shared across all chats)
    {channel}/
        AGENTS.md             # Bot/account memory for this channel
        {chat_id}/
            AGENTS.md         # Per-chat memory (namespaced by channel)
```

Memory is loaded into the system prompt on every request. The model can read and update memory through tools -- tell it to "remember that I prefer Python" and it will persist across sessions.

MicroClaw also keeps structured memory rows in SQLite (`memories` table):
- `write_memory` persists to file memory and structured memory
- Background reflector extracts durable facts incrementally and deduplicates
- Explicit "remember ..." commands use a deterministic fast path (direct structured-memory upsert)
- Low-quality/noisy memories are filtered by quality gates before insertion
- Memory lifecycle is managed with confidence + soft-archive fields (instead of hard delete)

Optional memory MCP backend:
- If MCP config includes a server exposing both `memory_query` and `memory_upsert`, structured-memory operations prefer that MCP server.
- If MCP is not configured, unavailable, or returns invalid payloads, MicroClaw automatically falls back to built-in SQLite memory behavior.
- Fallback is per operation. External-provider failures are classified as `timeout`, `transport`, `invalid_payload`, or `unsupported_operation` in health/self-check output.
- Startup runs a lightweight probe against the external provider. If it fails, foreground memory operations can still continue through SQLite fallback.
- This mode favors availability over strict cross-store consistency: SQLite fallback writes are not automatically backfilled into the external provider after recovery, and reflector background writes pause while the external provider is unhealthy to limit divergence.

When built with `--features sqlite-vec` and embedding config is set, structured-memory retrieval and dedup use semantic KNN. Otherwise, it falls back to keyword relevance + Jaccard dedup.

`/usage` now includes a **Memory Observability** section (and Web UI panel) showing:
- memory pool health (active/archived/low-confidence)
- reflector throughput (insert/update/skip in 24h)
- injection coverage (selected vs candidate memories in 24h)

### Chat Identity Mapping

MicroClaw now stores a channel-scoped identity for chats:

- `internal chat_id`: SQLite primary key used by sessions/messages/tasks
- `channel + external_chat_id`: source chat identity from Telegram/Discord/Slack/Feishu/OpenClaw Weixin/IRC/Web

This avoids collisions when different channels can have the same numeric id. Legacy rows are migrated automatically on startup.

Useful SQL for debugging:

```sql
SELECT chat_id, channel, external_chat_id, chat_type, chat_title
FROM chats
ORDER BY last_message_time DESC
LIMIT 50;

SELECT id, chat_id, chat_channel, external_chat_id, category, content, embedding_model
FROM memories
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## Skills

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/skills-lifecycle.svg" alt="MicroClaw skill lifecycle diagram" width="92%" />
</p>

MicroClaw supports the [Anthropic Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) standard. Skills are modular packages that give the bot specialized capabilities for specific tasks.

```
<data_dir>/skills/
    pdf/
        SKILL.md              # Required: name, description + instructions
    docx/
        SKILL.md
```

**How it works:**
1. Skill metadata (name + description) is always included in the system prompt (~100 tokens per skill)
2. When the model determines a skill is relevant, it calls `activate_skill` to load the full instructions
3. The model follows the skill instructions to complete the task

**Built-in skills:** pdf, docx, xlsx, pptx, skill-creator, apple-notes, apple-reminders, apple-calendar, weather, find-skills

**New macOS skills (examples):**
- `apple-notes` -- manage Apple Notes via `memo`
- `apple-reminders` -- manage Apple Reminders via `remindctl`
- `apple-calendar` -- query/create Calendar events via `icalBuddy` + `osascript`
- `weather` -- quick weather lookup via `wttr.in`

**Adding a skill:** Create a subdirectory under `<data_dir>/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions.

Supported frontmatter fields:
- `name`, `description`
- `platforms` (optional): e.g. `[darwin, linux, windows]`
- `deps` (optional): required commands in `PATH`
- `compatibility.os` / `compatibility.deps` (also supported)

Unavailable skills are filtered automatically by platform/dependencies, so unsupported skills do not appear in `/skills`.

## Plugins

MicroClaw supports manifest-based plugins for:

- Slash commands (for example `/uptime`, `/announce hello`)
- Dynamic tools exposed to the agent loop
- Per-turn context providers (prompt/document injections)

Default plugins directory:

- `<data_dir>/plugins`

Optional override:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: "./microclaw.data/plugins"
```

Plugin admin commands (control chats):

- `/plugins list`
- `/plugins validate`
- `/plugins reload`

See full manifest schema and examples: `docs/plugins/overview.md`.

**Commands:**
- `/stop` -- abort the current active run in this chat (keeps history/session data)
- `/clear` -- clear current chat context (session + chat history), keep scheduled tasks
- `/reset` -- clear current chat context (session + chat history) and scheduled task state
- `/reset memory` -- clear current chat memory (chat AGENTS.md + structured memories), keep conversation and tasks
- `/skills` -- list all available skills
- `/reload-skills` -- reload skills from disk
- `/archive` -- archive current in-memory session as markdown
- `/usage` -- show token usage summary (current chat + global totals)
- `/status` -- show provider/model plus current chat session/task status
- `/providers` -- list configured provider profiles and show the active one
- `/provider` -- show current provider/model (`/provider <profile>` switches the current channel to that profile and persists it to config; `/provider reset` clears it)
- `/models` -- list configured models for the active provider (`/models api` fetches the live provider model list when supported)
- `/model` -- show current provider/model (`/model <name>` switches the current channel model override and persists it to config; `/model reset` clears it)

Command handling rules:
- Any input starting with `/` is treated as a command.
- Inputs with leading mentions before slash are also treated as commands (for example `@bot /status`, `<@U123> /status`).
- Slash commands do **not** enter agent conversation history/session context.
- Unknown slash commands return `Unknown command.`.
- Use `/stop` to interrupt an in-flight run, `/clear` to wipe chat context only, and `/reset` to wipe chat context plus scheduled task state.

## MCP

MicroClaw supports MCP servers configured in `<data_dir>/mcp.json` and optional fragments in `<data_dir>/mcp.d/*.json` with protocol negotiation and configurable transport.

- Default protocol version: `2025-11-05` (overridable globally or per server)
- Supported transports: `stdio`, `streamable_http`

Recommended production start (minimal local MCP only):

```sh
cp mcp.minimal.example.json <data_dir>/mcp.json
```

Full example (includes optional remote streamable HTTP server):

```sh
cp mcp.example.json <data_dir>/mcp.json
```

For sidecar-style integrations (for example a separate HAPI bridge process), prefer a dedicated fragment:

```sh
mkdir -p <data_dir>/mcp.d
cp mcp.hapi-bridge.example.json <data_dir>/mcp.d/hapi-bridge.json
```

Detailed ops guide: `docs/operations/hapi-bridge.md`.

OpenClaw Weixin native guide:
`docs/operations/weixin.md`.

Example:

```json
{
  "defaultProtocolVersion": "2025-11-05",
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
    },
    "remote": {
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Browser Automation with Playwright MCP

To give your agent access to a real browser with your existing logins (cookies, sessions), use the [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) server in **extension mode**:

1. Install the **Playwright MCP Bridge** extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/playwright-mcp-bridge)
2. Click the extension icon and copy the `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN`
3. Add to your `mcp.json` (or `<data_dir>/mcp.d/playwright.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--extension"],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN": "<your-token-here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This connects directly to your running Chrome via the extension's `chrome.debugger` API — no `--remote-debugging-port` flag needed. Your agent gets full access to your logged-in sessions (X, Google, GitHub, etc.) without any CDP setup.

> **Note:** Chrome 136+ blocks `--remote-debugging-port` on the default user data directory and DPAPI cookie encryption is path-bound on Windows, so CDP-based approaches (`--cdp-endpoint`) will not preserve logins. Extension mode is the recommended solution.

Migration evaluation to official Rust SDK is tracked in `docs/mcp-sdk-evaluation.md`.

Validation:

```sh
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- start
```

Look for log lines like `MCP server '...' connected (...)`.

### macOS Desktop Automation with Peekaboo MCP

[Peekaboo](https://github.com/steipete/Peekaboo) is a macOS desktop automation MCP server. MicroClaw can use it directly via `stdio` transport (no runtime code changes needed).

```sh
mkdir -p <data_dir>/mcp.d
cp mcp.peekaboo.example.json <data_dir>/mcp.d/peekaboo.json
```

`mcp.peekaboo.example.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peekaboo": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "peekaboo-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows Desktop Automation Options

MicroClaw can also consume Windows desktop automation MCP servers via `stdio`.

```sh
mkdir -p <data_dir>/mcp.d
cp mcp.windows.desktop.example.json <data_dir>/mcp.d/windows-desktop.json
```

`mcp.windows.desktop.example.json` includes:
- `pywinauto` (native Windows desktop UI automation, stdio MCP)
- optional `playwright` MCP for browser automation on Windows

Note: some Windows MCP projects expose only `sse` transport. MicroClaw runtime currently supports `stdio` and `streamable_http` transports only, so SSE-only servers need a protocol bridge before use.

## Plan & Execute

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/plan-execute.svg" alt="MicroClaw plan and execute diagram" width="92%" />
</p>

For complex, multi-step tasks, the bot can create a plan and track progress:

```
You: Set up a new Rust project with CI, tests, and documentation
Bot: [creates a todo plan, then executes each step, updating progress]

1. [x] Create project structure
2. [x] Add CI configuration
3. [~] Write unit tests
4. [ ] Add documentation
```

Todo lists are stored at `<data_dir>/runtime/groups/{chat_id}/TODO.json` and persist across sessions.

## Scheduling

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/task-scheduler.svg" alt="MicroClaw scheduling flow diagram" width="92%" />
</p>

The bot supports scheduled tasks via natural language:

- **Recurring:** "Remind me to check the logs every 30 minutes" -- creates a cron task
- **One-time:** "Remind me at 5pm to call Alice" -- creates a one-shot task

Under the hood, recurring tasks use 6-field cron expressions (sec min hour dom month dow). The scheduler polls every 60 seconds for due tasks, runs the agent loop with the task prompt, and sends results to the originating chat.

Manage tasks with natural language:
```
"List my scheduled tasks"
"Pause task #3"
"Resume task #3"
"Cancel task #3"
```

## Local Web UI (cross-channel history)

When `web_enabled: true`, MicroClaw serves a local Web UI (default `http://127.0.0.1:10961`).

- Session list includes chats from all channels stored in SQLite (`telegram`, `discord`, `slack`, `feishu`, `irc`, `web`)
- You can review and manage history (refresh / clear context / delete)
- Non-web channels are read-only in Web UI by default (send from source channel)
- If there are no sessions yet, Web UI auto-generates a new key like `session-YYYYMMDDHHmmss`
- The first message in that session automatically persists it in SQLite
- If no Web operator password exists, MicroClaw initializes a temporary default password `helloworld` and prompts you to change it after sign-in (you can skip temporarily)
- Password reset helpers:
  - `microclaw web` (show usage)
  - `microclaw web password <value>`
  - `microclaw web password-generate`
  - `microclaw web password-clear`

### HTTP Request Trigger (headless automation)

For external automation (webhooks, CI, scripts), use the Web API with an API key that has
`operator.write` scope.

Detailed guide: [`docs/operations/http-hook-trigger.md`](docs/operations/http-hook-trigger.md)

Endpoints:
- `POST /api/send` (canonical)
- `POST /api/chat` (alias for chatbot-style clients)
- `POST /api/send_stream` (async run + SSE replay)
- `POST /api/chat_stream` (alias for chatbot-style clients)
- `GET /` accepts WebSocket upgrade for the OpenClaw Mission Control-compatible bridge
- `POST /hooks/agent` and `POST /api/hooks/agent` (OpenClaw-style webhook payload compatibility)
- `POST /hooks/wake` and `POST /api/hooks/wake` (system-event wake trigger: `now` or `next-heartbeat`)

Hook auth + policy (`channels.web`):
```yaml
channels:
  web:
    hooks_token: "replace-with-secret"
    hooks_default_session_key: "hook:ingress"
    hooks_allow_request_session_key: false
    hooks_allowed_session_key_prefixes: ["hook:"]
```

Notes:
- `/hooks/*` requires hook token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `x-openclaw-token`).
- `sessionKey` in request body is rejected by default unless `hooks_allow_request_session_key: true`.
- If you enable request `sessionKey`, use prefix allowlist to avoid arbitrary session routing.

Request body:
```json
{
  "session_key": "ops-bot",
  "sender_name": "automation",
  "message": "Check error budget and summarize incidents in the last hour."
}
```

Synchronous response (`/api/send` or `/api/chat`):
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "session_key": "ops-bot",
  "chat_id": 123,
  "response": "..."
}
```

Async streaming response (`/api/send_stream` or `/api/chat_stream`):
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "run_id": "6f4c2b1d-...",
  "session_key": "ops-bot",
  "chat_id": 123
}
```

Consume SSE events:
```sh
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:10961/api/stream?run_id=<RUN_ID>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MICROCLAW_API_KEY"
```

Mission Control / OpenClaw-style WebSocket bridge:

1. Connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:10961/`
2. Wait for `connect.challenge`
3. Send a `connect` frame with your operator API key in `params.auth.token`
4. Use bridge methods such as `chat.send`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_kill`, `sessions_spawn`, and `session_set*`
5. Consume live `chat` events (`delta` / `final` / `error`)

Current bridge methods:

- `health`
- `status`
- `chat.send`
- `chat.history`
- `session_delete`
- `sessions_send`
- `sessions_kill`
- `sessions_spawn`
- `session_setThinking`
- `session_setVerbose`
- `session_setReasoning`
- `session_setLabel`
- `agents.list`
- `models.list`
- `config.get`
- `node.list`

Example connect frame:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "connect-1",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 3,
    "maxProtocol": 3,
    "auth": { "token": "mc_..." }
  }
}
```

Example chat send frame:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "send-1",
  "method": "chat.send",
  "params": {
    "sessionKey": "ops-bot",
    "message": "Summarize the current repo",
    "idempotencyKey": "idem-1"
  }
}
```

Example session spawn frame:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "spawn-1",
  "method": "sessions_spawn",
  "params": {
    "task": "Summarize the current repo",
    "label": "Ops"
  }
}
```

Example session label update:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "label-1",
  "method": "session_setLabel",
  "params": {
    "sessionKey": "ops-bot",
    "label": "Ops"
  }
}
```

Behavior notes:

- The bridge is mounted at `GET /` for WebSocket upgrades, not `/ws`.
- `sessions_send` returns a `runId` immediately and then emits `chat` events, including a terminal `final` state for normal messages.
- `sessions_spawn` can create a new async session and persist an initial label.
- `session_set*` updates only the provided field and preserves previously stored session settings.
- `sessions_send` control payloads are acknowledged, but not yet enforced as runtime controls.

Local gateway smoke tests:

```sh
MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=mc_... microclaw gateway call health
MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=mc_... microclaw gateway call status
MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=mc_... microclaw gateway call session_setLabel \
  --params '{"sessionKey":"ops-bot","label":"Ops"}'
MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=mc_... microclaw gateway call sessions_send \
  --params '{"sessionKey":"ops-bot","message":"status summary"}'
```

`microclaw gateway call` resolves connection settings from:

- `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`, `GATEWAY_URL`
- `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_HOST`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_HOST`, `GATEWAY_HOST`
- `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, `GATEWAY_PORT`
- `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `MICROCLAW_API_KEY`

Example:
```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:10961/api/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MICROCLAW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_key":"ops-bot","sender_name":"automation","message":"status summary"}'
```

OpenClaw-compatible webhook shape:
```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:10961/hooks/agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MICROCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Summarize inbox","name":"Email","sessionKey":"hook:email:msg-123"}'
```

Wake example:
```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:10961/hooks/wake \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MICROCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"New email received","mode":"now"}'
```

## Release

Publish both installer mode (GitHub Release asset used by `install.sh`) and Homebrew mode with one command:

```sh
./deploy.sh
```

Nixpkgs upstream/update playbook:

## Setup

> **New:** MicroClaw now includes an interactive setup wizard (`microclaw setup`) and will auto-launch it on first `start` when required config is missing.

### 1. Create channel bot credentials

Enable at least one channel, or use Web UI (enabled by default).

Telegram (optional):
1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Enter a display name for your bot (e.g. `My MicroClaw`)
4. Enter a username (must end in `bot`, e.g. `my_microclaw_bot`)
5. BotFather will reply with a token like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz` -- save this as `telegram_bot_token` (legacy single-account) or `channels.telegram.accounts.<id>.bot_token` (recommended multi-account)

Recommended BotFather settings (optional but useful):
- `/setdescription` -- set a short description shown in the bot's profile
- `/setcommands` -- register commands so users see them in the menu:
  ```
  reset - Clear current session
  status - Show runtime/session status
  model - Show current provider/model
  skills - List available agent skills
  usage - Show usage summary
  ```
- `/setprivacy` -- set to `Disable` if you want the bot to see all group messages (not just @mentions)

Discord (optional):
1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create an application and add a bot
3. Copy the bot token and save it as `discord_bot_token`
4. Invite the bot to your server with `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, and mention permissions
5. Optional: set `discord_allowed_channels` to restrict where the bot can reply

Slack (optional, Socket Mode):
1. Create an app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Enable Socket Mode and get an `app_token` (starts with `xapp-`)
3. Add `bot_token` scope and install to workspace to get `bot_token` (starts with `xoxb-`)
4. Subscribe to `message` and `app_mention` events
5. Configure under `channels.slack` in config

Feishu/Lark (optional):
1. Create an app at the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/app) (or [Lark Developer](https://open.larksuite.com/app) for international)
2. Get `app_id` and `app_secret` from app credentials
3. Enable `im:message` and `im:message.receive_v1` event subscription
4. Choose connection mode: WebSocket (default, no public URL needed) or Webhook
5. Configure under `channels.feishu` in config; set `domain: "lark"` for international

IRC (optional):
1. Prepare an IRC server endpoint, port, and bot nick
2. Configure under `channels.irc` in config (`server`, `nick`, `channels` are required)
3. Optional: enable TLS with `tls: "true"` and set `tls_server_name` if needed
4. Optional: set `mention_required: "false"` if you want replies in channels without mention

### 2. Get an LLM API key

Choose a provider and create an API key:
- Anthropic: [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- OpenAI: [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Or any OpenAI-compatible provider (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, etc.)
- For `openai-codex`, you can use OAuth (`codex login`) or an API key (for OpenAI-compatible proxy endpoints).

### 3. Configure (recommended: interactive Q&A)

```sh
microclaw setup
```

<!-- Setup wizard screenshot placeholder -->
<!-- Replace with real screenshot later -->
![Setup Wizard (placeholder)](screenshots/setup-wizard.png)

The `config` flow provides:
- Question-by-question prompts with defaults (`Enter` to confirm quickly)
- Provider selection + model selection (numbered choices with custom override)
- Better Ollama UX: local model auto-detection + sensible local defaults
- Channel credentials are written in multi-account form by default (`channels.<channel>.default_account` + `channels.<channel>.accounts.main`)
- Per-bot `soul_path` picker for Telegram/dynamic channels (auto-discovers `souls/*.md`, also supports manual filename/path input)
- Safe `microclaw.config.yaml` save with automatic backup in `microclaw.config.backups/` (keeps latest 50)
- Auto-created directories for `data_dir` and `working_dir`

If you prefer the full-screen TUI, you can still run:

```sh
microclaw setup
```

Provider presets available in the wizard:
- `openai`
- `openai-codex` (ChatGPT/Codex subscription OAuth; run `codex login`)
- `openrouter`
- `anthropic`
- `ollama`
- `google`
- `alibaba`
- `deepseek`
- `moonshot`
- `mistral`
- `azure`
- `bedrock`
- `zhipu`
- `minimax`
- `cohere`
- `tencent`
- `xai`
- `huggingface`
- `together`
- `custom` (manual provider/model/base URL)

For Ollama, `llm_base_url` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`, `api_key` is optional, and the interactive setup wizard can auto-detect locally installed models.

For `openai-codex`, you can run `codex login` first and MicroClaw will read OAuth from `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`). You can also provide `api_key` when using an OpenAI-compatible proxy endpoint. The default base URL is `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`.

You can still configure manually with `microclaw.config.yaml`:

```

### 4. Run

```sh
microclaw start
```

### 5. Run as persistent gateway service (optional)

```sh
microclaw gateway install
microclaw gateway status
microclaw gateway status --json
```

Manage service lifecycle:

```sh
microclaw gateway install --force
microclaw gateway start
microclaw gateway stop
microclaw gateway restart
microclaw gateway logs 200
microclaw gateway uninstall
```

Notes:
- macOS uses `launchd` user agents.
- Linux uses `systemd --user`.
- Windows uses a native Windows Service hosted directly by `microclaw.exe`. Run gateway service commands from an elevated terminal, and make sure `microclaw.config.yaml` already exists before `microclaw gateway install`.
- Runtime logs are written to `<data_dir>/runtime/logs/`.
- macOS launchd stdout/stderr files are `microclaw-gateway.log` and `microclaw-gateway.error.log`.
- Logs older than 30 days are deleted automatically.

### 6. Run as an ACP stdio server (optional)

MicroClaw can also expose an Agent Client Protocol server over stdio:

```sh
microclaw acp
```

Use this mode when another local tool wants to talk to MicroClaw as a sessioned chat runtime over stdio instead of through Telegram, Discord, or the Web UI.

Path compatibility policy:
- If `data_dir` / `skills_dir` / `working_dir` are already configured, MicroClaw keeps using those configured paths.
- If these fields are not configured, defaults are `data_dir=~/.microclaw`, `skills_dir=<data_dir>/skills`, `working_dir=~/.microclaw/working_dir`.

`*` At least one channel configuration must be enabled; `web_enabled` is on by default.

### OpenAI-compatible body overrides

These fields let you pass custom JSON parameters to OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` or `/responses` requests without adding provider-specific code.

Merge order (later wins):
1. `openai_compat_body_overrides` (global)
2. `openai_compat_body_overrides_by_provider[llm_provider]`
3. `openai_compat_body_overrides_by_model[model]`

`null` unsets a key:

```yaml
llm_provider: "deepseek"
model: "deepseek-chat"

openai_compat_body_overrides:
  temperature: 0.2

openai_compat_body_overrides_by_provider:
  deepseek:
    top_p: null
    reasoning_effort: "high"

openai_compat_body_overrides_by_model:
  deepseek-chat:
    temperature: 0.0
```

Notes:
- `provider` keys are normalized to lowercase (`OPENAI` and `openai` are equivalent).
- `model` keys are exact-match after trimming.
- Runtime-controlled fields like stream mode and tool payload may still be set by MicroClaw for the active request path.

## Docker Sandbox

Use this when you want `bash` tool calls to run in Docker containers instead of the host.

Quick config:

```sh
microclaw setup --enable-sandbox
microclaw doctor sandbox
```

Or configure manually:

```yaml
sandbox:
  mode: "all"
  backend: "auto"
  security_profile: "hardened" # optional; hardened|standard|privileged, default hardened
  # optional capability overrides (applies to hardened/standard)
  # cap_add: ["SETUID", "SETGID", "CHOWN"]
  image: "ubuntu:25.10"
  container_prefix: "microclaw-sandbox"
  no_network: true
  require_runtime: true
  # optional external allowlist file
  # mount_allowlist_path: "~/.microclaw/sandbox-mount-allowlist.txt"
```

How to test:

```sh
docker info
docker run --rm ubuntu:25.10 echo ok
microclaw start
```

Then ask the agent to run:
- `cat /etc/os-release`
- `pwd`

Notes:
- `sandbox.mode: "off"` (default) means `bash` runs on host.
- Recommended production posture: `sandbox.mode=all`, `require_runtime=true`, `security_profile=hardened`, and keep high-risk confirmation enabled.
- `sandbox.security_profile` defaults to `hardened` (same behavior as old hardcoded settings):
  - `hardened`: `--cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges`
  - `standard`: Docker default capabilities (useful for `apt/chown/su` in sandbox)
  - `privileged`: full container privilege (`--privileged`), debugging only
- `sandbox.cap_add` appends `--cap-add` entries for `hardened` and `standard`.
- If `mode: "all"` and Docker is unavailable:
  - `require_runtime: false` -> fallback to host with warning.
  - `require_runtime: true` -> command fails fast.
- Optional hardening:
  - `~/.microclaw/sandbox-mount-allowlist.txt` for sandbox mount roots.
  - `~/.microclaw/sandbox-path-allowlist.txt` for file tool path roots.

Working directory guidance:
- `bash` runs inside the current chat working directory under its `tmp/` subdirectory.
- Prefer relative paths or paths under the current chat working directory instead of absolute `/tmp/...`.
- If a command fails with `command not found`, install the dependency on the host or use a sandbox image that includes it.

### Supported `llm_provider` values

`openai`, `openai-codex`, `openrouter`, `anthropic`, `ollama`, `google`, `alibaba`, `aliyun-bailian`, `nvidia`, `deepseek`, `moonshot`, `mistral`, `azure`, `bedrock`, `zhipu`, `minimax`, `cohere`, `tencent`, `xai`, `huggingface`, `together`, `custom`.

## Platform behavior

- Telegram private chats: respond to every message.
- Telegram groups: respond only when mentioned with the active account username (for example `@my_bot` or `@support_bot` in multi-account mode); all group messages are still stored for context.
- Discord DMs: respond to every message.
- Discord server channels: respond on @mention; optionally constrained by `discord_allowed_channels`.
- Slack DMs: respond to every message.
- Slack channels: respond on @mention; optionally constrained by `allowed_channels`.
- Feishu/Lark DMs (p2p): respond to every message.
- Feishu/Lark groups: respond on @mention; optionally constrained by `allowed_chats`.
- Feishu/Lark emoji reactions: model can choose reaction-only (`reaction-only: 👍`), reaction+reply (`reaction: 👍` then text), or plain text; single-token reactions auto-fallback to text if reaction API fails.
- IRC private messages: respond to every message.
- IRC channels: by default respond on mention; configurable via `channels.irc.mention_required`.
- Group/server/channel slash commands are mention-gated by default; set `allow_group_slash_without_mention: true` to restore permissive behavior.

**Catch-up behavior (Telegram groups):** When mentioned in a group, the bot loads all messages since its last reply in that group (instead of just the last N messages). This means it catches up on everything it missed, making group interactions much more contextual.

## Multi-chat permission model

Tool calls are authorized against the current chat:

- Non-control chats can only operate on their own `chat_id`
- Control chats (`control_chat_ids`) can operate across chats
- `write_memory` with `scope: "global"` is restricted to control chats

Affected tools include `send_message`, scheduling tools, `export_chat`, `todo_*`, and chat-scoped memory operations.

## Usage examples

**Web search:**
```
You: Search the web for the latest Rust release notes
Bot: [searches DuckDuckGo, returns top results with links]
```

**Web fetch:**
```
You: Fetch https://example.com and summarize it
Bot: [fetches page, strips HTML, summarizes content]
```

**Scheduling:**
```
You: Every morning at 9am, check the weather in Tokyo and send me a summary
Bot: Task #1 scheduled. Next run: 2025-06-15T09:00:00+00:00

[Next morning at 9am, bot automatically sends weather summary]
```

**Mid-conversation messaging:**
```
You: Analyze all log files in /var/log and give me a security report
Bot: [sends "Scanning log files..." as progress update]
Bot: [sends "Found 3 suspicious entries, analyzing..." as progress update]
Bot: [sends final security report]
```

**Coding help:**
```
You: Find all TODO comments in this project and fix them
Bot: [greps for TODOs, reads files, edits them, reports what was done]
```

**Memory:**
```
You: Remember that the production database is on port 5433
Bot: Saved to chat memory.

[Three days later]
You: What port is the prod database on?
Bot: Port 5433.
```

## Architecture

```
crates/
    microclaw-core/      # Shared error/types/text modules
    microclaw-storage/   # SQLite DB + memory domain + usage reporting
    microclaw-tools/     # Tool runtime primitives + sandbox + helper engines
    microclaw-channels/  # Channel abstractions and routing boundary
    microclaw-app/       # App-level support modules (logging, builtin skills, transcribe)

src/
    main.rs              # CLI entry point
    runtime.rs           # Runtime bootstrap + adapter startup
    agent_engine.rs      # Channel-agnostic agent loop
    llm.rs               # Provider abstraction (Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible/Codex)
    channels/*.rs        # Concrete channel adapters (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Feishu/IRC)
    tools/*.rs           # Built-in tool implementations + registry assembly
    scheduler.rs         # Background scheduler and reflector loop
    web.rs               # Web API + stream endpoints
```

Key design decisions:
- **Session resume** persists full message history (including tool blocks) in SQLite; context compaction summarizes old messages to stay within limits
- **Provider abstraction** with native Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **SQLite with WAL mode** for concurrent read/write from async context
- **Exponential backoff** on 429 rate limits (3 retries)
- **Message splitting** for long channel responses
- **`Arc<Database>`** shared across tools and scheduler for thread-safe DB access
- **Continuous typing indicator** via a spawned task that sends typing action every 4 seconds

## Adding a New Platform Adapter

MicroClaw's core loop is channel-agnostic. A new platform integration should mainly be an adapter layer:

1. Implement inbound mapping from platform events into canonical chat inputs (`chat_id`, sender, chat type, content blocks).
2. Reuse the shared `process_with_agent` flow instead of creating a platform-specific agent loop.
3. Implement outbound delivery for text and attachment responses (including platform-specific length limits).
4. Define mention/reply trigger rules for group/server contexts.
5. Preserve session key stability so resume/compaction/memory continue to work across restarts.
6. Apply existing authorization and safety boundaries (`control_chat_ids`, tool constraints, path guard).
7. Add adapter-specific integration tests under `TEST.md` patterns (DM/private, group/server mention, `/reset`, limits, failures).

## Observability (Langfuse)

MicroClaw supports OpenTelemetry (OTLP)-based observability and provides first-class integration with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). You can trace complete agent runs (`agent_run`), inspect `llm_generation` and `tool_execution` spans, and monitor token usage.

### 5-minute quick start (first-time users)

1. **Deploy Langfuse**
   - **Cloud**: use `https://cloud.langfuse.com`
   - **Self-hosted**: follow the official Langfuse self-hosting guide and make sure the UI is reachable (for example `http://127.0.0.1:3000`)
2. **Create a Langfuse project** and copy:
   - `langfuse_public_key` (`pk-lf-...`)
   - `langfuse_secret_key` (`sk-lf-...`)
3. **Configure MicroClaw** in `microclaw.config.yaml`
4. **Restart MicroClaw**
5. **Send one test message** in Web/Telegram/Discord and open Langfuse Traces

### Recommended config

```yaml
observability:
  service_name: "microclaw-agent"
  otlp_tracing_enabled: true
  langfuse_host: "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # or "http://127.0.0.1:3000" for self-hosted
  langfuse_public_key: "pk-lf-..."
  langfuse_secret_key: "sk-lf-..."
  otlp_tracing_max_queue_size: 8192
  otlp_tracing_max_export_batch_size: 512
  otlp_tracing_scheduled_delay_ms: 5000
```

### Verify it is working

- Start MicroClaw with debug logs:

```sh
RUST_LOG=info,microclaw_observability=debug,opentelemetry_sdk=info microclaw start
```

- Look for:
  - `otlp trace exporter initialized`
  - `trace span submitted to otel sdk`
- In Langfuse, verify:
  - Trace name: `agent_run`
  - Child spans: `llm_generation`, `tool_execution`
  - Token usage fields are non-zero after real model output

### Common pitfalls (read this before troubleshooting)

- **Wrong `langfuse_host` value**
  - Use only host root like `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
  - Do not use UI path like `/project/<id>/traces`
  - Do not append `/api/public/otel/v1/traces`
- **Proxy intercepts local Langfuse traffic**
  - If logs show proxy intercepting local URL, set:

```sh
export NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,<your-langfuse-host>
export no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost,<your-langfuse-host>
```

- **Docker networking confusion**
  - If MicroClaw runs in container, `127.0.0.1` points to that container, not your host
  - Use a container-reachable hostname (for example `http://langfuse-web:3000`)
- **No traces after config change**
  - Restart MicroClaw after editing config
  - Send a fresh test request
- **Too noisy OpenTelemetry timer debug logs**
  - Raise SDK log level: `opentelemetry_sdk=info`
- **Usage fields look incorrect in older runs**
  - Old traces are not backfilled; validate with new runs after upgrade
